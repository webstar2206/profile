            <p>A web browser or frequently called as browser is an application software that is installed on a computer
                to provide access to the World Wide Web. It fetches the web pages from the server along with the
                necessary files like, images, flashes, videos etc, interprets them and then displays it on the screen. All you
                have to do is simply type the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of a webpage in the address bar and the
                browser will bring the web page on your screen</p>
            <p id="top1">Web browser functions are to provide the resources or information to the user when asked by
                them.
                 It processes the user inputs in the form of URL like http://www.google.com in the browser and
                allows the access to that page.
                 URL is used to identify the resources and fetch them from the server and displays it to the client.
                 It allows the user to interact with the web pages and dynamic content like surveys, forms, etc.
                 It also allows the user to navigate through the complete web page and see its source code in the+
                HTML format.
                 It provides security to the data and the resources that are available on the web that is by using the
                secure methods.</p>
            <p id="top2">
                Title Bar – The text that appears at the top of the browser window is called the title bar. This usually
                includes text that describes the content that appears on the web page.
                Toolbar – A tool bar is a menu bar of buttons and input boxes on the browser.
                Address Field – This input box displays the address, or URL, of the webpage you are viewing. You can
                enter any web address in this box to navigate to new pages. You can also copy a URL (web page address)
                and paste it into this box.
                RSS Button – If a web page offers and RSS feed, in most modern browsers, you will see the orange
                square with white lines. This indicates an RSS feed is available for that particular web page. You can
                click this button to open a new dialogue box in your browser that will give you options for subscribing to
                this RSS feed.
                Search Box – The search box is a standard on most modern web browsers. Instead of visiting Google or
                Yahoo! to search for something, just enter your search phrase into this box on the top left of your browser
                and hit enter. The browser should automatically send the query to the desired search engine and send you
                to a search engine results page. Google Chrome works a little differently in that both the address field and
                the search box are combined in the same field. You can type either a URL or a search query, and Google
                will send you to the appropriate page.
                Status Bar - The status bar appears at the bottom of your web browser. When you are loading a web
                page, this bar usually will show the browser’s progress. Also, when you hover links with your pointer, the
                address of those links will often appear in this status box. This allows you to see which web page your
                browser will load before clicking the link. The status bar can offer more functions when you add
                extensions or add ons to your browsers.
                Tabs - Tabs give your browser the ability to load multiple web pages without opening a new window. To
                open a new tab, press Ctrl+T. You then will have a new tab where you can open a new web page and
                easily switch back and forth between your other tabs. When multitasking, web work without tabs would
                be nearly impossible.
                Bookmarks - A bookmark is a saved shortcut that directs your browser to a specific webpage. It stores
                the title, URL, and favicon of the corresponding page. Saving bookmarks allows you to easily access your
                favorite locations on the Web. All major web browsers allow you to create bookmarks, though each
                browser provides a slightly different way of managing them. For example, Chrome and Firefox display
                your bookmarks in an open window, while Safari displays them in a list in the sidebar of the browser
                window. Internet Explorer uses the name "Favorites" to refer to bookmarks, and like Safari, it displays all
                your favorites in a list within the browser window sidebar.
                NOTE: A bookmark only stores the location of a webpage, not store the contents of the webpage itself.
                Therefore, when you open a previously saved bookmark, the contents of page may have changed since the
                last time you viewed it.

            <p id="top3">Cookies are small pieces of information websites store on your computer. Cookies only contain bits of
                text, not anything else. The text can be a user ID, session ID, or any other text. For example, web pages
                can be configurable – a web page could have a Hide link that hides a certain element on the page. The
                page can save this setting on your computer with a cookie. When you load the page in the future, the page
                can examine the cookie and automatically hide the element.
                If you clear your cookies, you’ll be logged out of all websites and websites won’t remember any settings
                you’ve changed on them.
                Cookies are very common – you probably have hundreds or even thousands stored in your browser right
                now.
                How Cookies Work
                Your web browser stores and manages cookies. You can find a list of websites storing cookies and view
                the cookies themselves – although it’s usually not interesting to look at the content of the cookies – in
                your browser’s settings. If you use multiple web browsers on your computer, each browser has its own set
                of cookies.
                Websites are only allowed to look at their own cookies – for example, when you visit How-To Geek, we
                can’t examine cookies from other websites. This prevents malicious websites from snooping and stealing
                your login sessions.
                Good Uses for Cookies
                As we’ve seen, cookies have a number of very important uses. The web wouldn’t be what it is without
                them today.
                 Cookies store your login state. Without them, you wouldn’t be able to log into websites. Websites use
                cookies to remember and identify you.
                 Cookies store preferences on websites. You couldn’t change settings and have them persist between
                page loads without cookies.
                 Cookies allow websites to provide personalized content. For example, if you’re shopping on Amazon,
                Amazon can remember the products you’ve browsed and recommend similar products – even if
                you’re not logged in.
