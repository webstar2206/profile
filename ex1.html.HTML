<li><p>New HTML5 web storage capabilities. In Chapter 11, we use HTML5’s new
web storage capabilities to create a web application that stores a user’s favorite
Twitter searches on the computer for easy access at a later time. Web storage replaces the controversial cookie technology, offering lots more storage space.
Chapter 11 also briefly introduces JSON, a means for creating JavaScript objects—typically for transferring data over the Internet between client-side and
server-side programs.

<li><p><b><i>Enhanced Craps game featuring HTML5 audio and video elements. The Craps
game in Chapter 9 now includes an HTML5 audio element that plays a dice-rolling sound each time the user rolls the dice. Also, we link to a page with an embedded HTML5 video element that plays a video explaining the rules of the game</i></b></p>

<li><p>jQuery Ajax case study. The previous edition of this book included a calendar application that used the Dojo libraries—which were popular at the time—to create
the user interface, communicate with the server asynchronously, handle events
and manipulate the DOM. Since then, jQuery has become the most popular
JavaScript library. For this edition, we’ve updated the calendar application
(Chapter 16) using jQuery and placed it online as a jQuery Ajax case study.

<li><p>New HTML5 WebSockets and Web Workers capabilities. We’ve added an online
treatment of two new technologies—WebSockets, which provides a simple
model for networking, and Web Workers which provides multithreading on a
web page.
</p></li>

<ul type=circle><li><p>Validated HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript code. All of the HTML5, CSS3 and
JavaScript code in the book was validated using validator.w3.org/ for
HTML5, jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator for CSS3 and javascriptlint.com
for JavaScript. Not every script fully validates but most do. Although all of the code
works properly, you may receive warnings (or possibly errors) when validating
code with some of the new features.
</p></li>
<li><p>Smartphone and tablet apps. You’re probably familiar with the explosion of apps
available for the iPhone/iPad and Android platforms. There’s almost a million
apps between the two. Previously, writing apps for these platforms required detailed knowledge of each, and in the case of iPhone/iPad, was strictly controlled
by Apple; Android is more open. With the techniques you’ll learn in this book,
you’ll be able to write apps that are portable between a great variety of desktop
and mobile platforms, including iPhone/iPad and Android. You’ll even be able
to sell those apps on your own terms (or through certain app stores as well). This
is an exciting possibility! It’s one of the true virtues of developing with HTML5,
CSS3 and JavaScript in general, and HTML5 canvas in particular. Running an
HTML5 app on your smartphone or tablet is as simple as opening it in your compliant web browser. You may still encounter some portability issues.

and type-ahead capabilities—each of these are key capabilities of Rich Internet
Applications
